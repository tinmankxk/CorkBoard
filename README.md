# corkboard
this is a mod for minecraft. It's not really great, but it's the best I can do.
get it at https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/corkboard

Description from Curse:
This mod is mostly a joke. I recommend you don't use it, but if you want to go ahead. 
At the moment, Corkboard adds an unbalanced sword that I will at some point (attempt to) balance out, the stuff to craft it, and 3 blocks, corkboard, a tile, and a brick.  
Eventually there will be the 16 minecraft color variants of the tile and brick, a pick, shovel and axe to go with the sword, and another set of tools and armor.  

New in version 1.0.3: Content and semi-balance update. The CorkBoard block can now be used grow sugarcane, cactus and netherwart(there is no growth acceleration, that might come later.) Updated the Tile and Tile Brick recipes. All blocks are updated with proper harvesting tools, and block hardness(how long they take to break.) Added a pickaxe to go with the future sword.

Several textures by Futureazoo are used from https://github.com/Futureazoo/TextureRepository
(capacitor, carbon fibre, carbon_fibre_plate, coal_dust, integrated_circuit, resistor, silicon, and sword_future)
